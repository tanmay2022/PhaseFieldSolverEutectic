The implementation, client and header files of the solver have been written following Open\+FOAM conventions. These are explained next with flow charts generated from the source code using Doxygen. It must be noted that the solver is based on \href{https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/guides/latest/doc/guide-applications-solvers-basic-laplacianFoam.html}{\texttt{ laplacian\+Foam}} solver within Open\+FOAM. Hence, it may be helpful for the user to become familiar with \href{http://foam.sourceforge.net/docs/Guides-a4/ProgrammersGuide.pdf}{\texttt{ Open\+FOAM Programmerâ€™s Guide}} and \href{https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/guides/latest/doc/guide-applications-solvers-basic-laplacianFoam.html}{\texttt{ laplacian\+Foam}} beforehand.
